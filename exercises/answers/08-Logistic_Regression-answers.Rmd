Logistic regression in many ways is similar to linear regression:

   * It is based on a particular "linear" formation.
   * Share a lot of the statistical assumptions that linear regression assumes.
   * Practically the commands for logistic regression in R are similar to those of linear regression.

The significant difference however is that instead of predicting an unbound value, we're predicting the **probability** of an event, i.e., a number between 0 and 1. For this reasone, it is widely used for **classification**, i.e., is a certain transaction a fraud or not, will a certain customer churn, will a lead convert...

Why can't we use linear regression for that?

We are trying to predict the following probabilistic event:

\[p(Y=1|X)\]

In short: 

\[p(X)\]

With **linear** regression we will get the following formula:

\[p(X) = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_1+\ldots\beta_p X_p\]

However, with this kind of formula we might get a number greater than 1 or lower than 0, which is not possible for a probability!

## Logit for the rescue

The following expression will always be in $[0, 1]$:

\[p(X)=\frac{e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \ldots + \beta_p x_p}}{1 + e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \ldots + \beta_p x_p}}\]

The expression in the power of $e$ is linear and very similar to what we used in linear regression.

## Odds ration

Another important term is odds ratio. In sport gambles it is widely common to see the ratio of winning against losing ("this hourse is a bet of 10 to 1"), in our formulation this becomes:

\[\frac{p(X)}{1-p(X)} = e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \ldots}\]

This emphasizes the meaning of the $\beta$ coefficients in logistic regression. If in linear regression they were used to measure the influence of a unit's change in $X$ on the dependent variable $y$, here in logistic regression it shows by how much the odds ration increases (multiplies) when a single unit of $X$ is added.

To compute the values of $\beta$ a mximum likelihood method is used, but we will not focus on the math here.

To run a logistic regression model we just have to put small modification to the already familiar `lm` command, mainly use `glm` instead:

```{r example for logistic regression, warnings=FALSE, messages=FALSE}

library(tidyverse)

# read the no show data of patients
appointments <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adisarid/Riskified_training/master/datasets/Medical_Appointments_No_Shows_KaggleV2-May-2016.csv") %>%
  mutate(no_show = `No-show` == "Yes") # change the Yes/No into True/False (which is like having 1-0)

# split to train and test set
appointments <- appointments %>%
  mutate(is_train = runif(NROW(appointments)) <= 0.8)

# build the linear regression model
appointments_model <- glm(formula = 
                            no_show ~ Gender + Age + Scholarship + Hipertension + Diabetes +
                            Alcoholism + Handcap + SMS_received,
                          family = binomial,
                          data = appointments %>% filter(is_train))

summary(appointments_model)

```

The results are displayed in a very similar manner to what we have already seen:

   * Coefficients now represent the power of $e$
   * Estimate of Scholarship = 0.17266, i.e., scholarship patients are 1.2 times more likely to not show up. 
   
We can access the coefficients like this:
   
```{r coefficient meaning in logistic regression}

exp(appointments_model$coefficients)

```

The R-Square we used in linear regression is now replaced by the AIC (the Akaike criteria). The lower Akaike, the better the model is. Similarly, the residuals are replaced with deviance.

As in the linear regression, we also get a statistical test for the hypothesis that the coefficients are non-zero.

## Exercise

The function `MASS:stepAIC` uses a "step-wise" algorithm to search for model improvements. In each step it tries to remove (or add) variables, and reach a better model.

   1. Try to improve the previous model by adding or removing variables, you can use `MASS:stepAIC`.
   
```{r stepwise to improve logistic regression, include=FALSE}

appointments_model_step <- MASS::stepAIC(object = appointments_model, direction = "both",
                                        trace = 2)

```

   2. Using a boxplot, show the results of the logistic regression model (probabilities between 0-1 on the y-axis) versus the actual no-show value. You can use the following code:

```
# use the help of ?predict.glm to understand what do you need to put in the type argument
# (we want the probability of not showing to the appointment).

appointments <- appointments %>%
   mutate(probability_no_show = predict(XXX,
                                        newdata = appointments %>% filter(!is_train),
                                        type = XXX))
```

```{r separate the outcome and chart by actual result, include = FALSE}
appointments <- appointments %>%
  mutate(probability_no_show = predict(appointments_model_step,
                                     newdata = appointments,
                                     type = "response"))

ggplot(appointments %>% filter(!is_train), aes(x = no_show, y = probability_no_show)) + 
  geom_boxplot()

```

   3. With logistic regression we get probabilities, however, very frequently we are actually interested in a classification rule that will help us make a decision (will show up, versus will not show up, double book the appointment or not). For example, such a rule may be that if a probability exceeds 0.2, we classify the patient as a no-show. Add a variable that classifies each patient (show/no-show) according to the model you developed in the previous step.

``` 
appointments <- appointments %>%
  mutate(XXX = XXX >= XXX)
```

```{r predicted no show, include=FALSE}
appointments <- appointments %>%
  mutate(predicted_no_show0.2 = probability_no_show >= 0.2)
```

One of the tools we have at hand is the confusion matrix. A confusion matrix can be used to understand how well are we performing. It shows how frequenctly are we successful or wrong, in each category:
   
```
|Val/Predict|FALSE|TRUE|
|     FALSE | TN  | FP |
|     TRUE  | FN  | TP |
```

Where

   * FP = False Positive = Type-I error
   * FN = False Negative = Type-II error

Or in other words:

   4. Build a confusion matrix for the vector you computed earlier, you can use the following code:

```
# This code will compute a confusion matrix using absolute numbers
confusion_abs <- appointments %>%
  filter(!is_train) %>%
  count(XXX, XXX) %>%
  spread(predicted_no_show0.2, XXX)

# It is also useful to have it in percentage of row
confusion_prc <- appointments %>%
  filter(!is_train) %>%
  count(XXX, XXX) %>%
  group_by(no_show) %>%
  mutate(prop = n/sum(n)) %>%
  select(-n) %>%
  spread(predicted_no_show0.2, XXX)

```

What is the type-I error rate? what is the type-II error rate?

```{r compute confusion matrix, include = FALSE}

confusion_abs <- appointments %>%
  filter(!is_train) %>%
  count(predicted_no_show0.2, no_show) %>%
  spread(predicted_no_show0.2, n)
  
confusion_prc <- appointments %>%
  filter(!is_train) %>%
  count(predicted_no_show0.2, no_show) %>%
  group_by(no_show) %>%
  mutate(prop = n/sum(n)) %>%
  select(-n) %>%
  spread(predicted_no_show0.2, prop)

# Type-I error is 32.2% and Type-II error is 52.9%
```

Now try a different more extreme threshold, i.e., 0.1 or 0.9. How does the type-I and type-II errors change?

## Optimization problem

   5. The insurance company is interested to conduct various activities to encourage patients to show up. Some patients will receive a phone call one day prior to the visit. The company is interested to generate a decision rule based on logistic regression results (combined with a proper threshold). The cost of calling a patient is 5 dollars, but the cost of no-show is 25 dollars. You are requested to suggest a proper probability threshold, from which a call will be made (based on the result of your logistic regression model + and the threshold you decide on). You can assume that a patient which receives a phone call will show up (with a probability of $100\%$).
   
```
# first, lets build a function that takes as an argument the threshold, and returns the total cost
compute_cost <- function(XXX){
   appointments_cost <- appointments %>%
      filter(!is_train) %>%
      mutate(predicted_outcome = probability_no_show >= threshold) %>%
      mutate(per_record_cost = 
                5*(predicted_outcome == 1 & no_show == 1) + 
                25*(XXX == 0 & XXX == XXX)
                0*(XXX = XXX & XXX == XXX) + 
                5*(XXX = XXX & XXX = XXX))
   return(sum(XXX))
}

# to get the function loaded into the environment just run the code 
# (ctrl+L when standing on the first line of the function or last line } of the function. 
# R will then run your code and "compile" the function.)

# Now for the second part, let's create an iteration for different probability thresholds to look for the 
# minimum cost.
# BONUS: this helper code is in a base R for loop. Can you also refactor it into a purrr::map_*?


# initialize a variable which will contain the cost
cost <- NULL
# now compute the cost as a function of varying thresholds
for (threshold in seq(from = XXX, to = XXX, by = XXX)){
   cost <- c(cost,
             compute_cost(XXX))
}

# now make a tibble containing the cost and the thresholds you used
cost_benefit <- tibble(threshold = seq(XXX), 
                       cost = cost)

# plot the cost as a function of threshold. When should the nurse call?
ggplot(cost_benefit, aes(XXX)) + 
  geom_point() + geom_line()
```

```{r function to return confusion, include = FALSE}
compute_cost <- function(threshold){
  appointments_tmp <- appointments %>%
    filter(!is_train) %>%
    mutate(predicted_outcome = probability_no_show >= threshold) %>%
    mutate(per_record_cost = 
             5*(predicted_outcome == 1 & no_show == 1) +
             25*(predicted_outcome == 0 & no_show == 1) +
             0*(predicted_outcome == 0 & no_show == 0) +
             5*(predicted_outcome == 1 & no_show == 0)
             )
  
  return(sum(appointments_tmp$per_record_cost))
}

# cost <- NULL
# for (i in seq(0, 1, 0.01)){
#   cost <- c(cost, compute_cost(i))
# }

# cost_benefit <- tibble(cost, threshold = seq(0, 1, 0.01))

cost_benefit <- tibble(threshold = seq(0, 1, 0.01)) %>% 
  mutate(cost = map_dbl(threshold, compute_cost))



ggplot(cost_benefit, aes(x = threshold, y = cost)) + 
  geom_point() + geom_line()

```

What would you recommend if the no show cost was 50 dollars instead of 25 dollars? what would you recommend if it was 5 dollars?

## ROC

ROC, short for Receiver Operating Characteristic, is a plot which helps us compare classification models. It was develpoed in the second world war when the American army tried to compare methods for recognizing Japanese planes. 

ROC shows the rate of detecting an event (sensitivity, detecting a no-show in our case), versus the specificity (misclassifying a show as a non-show).

In our confusion matrix terminology, that's a True Positive rate on the y-axis versus False Positive rate on the x-axis.

Use the following instructions to generate an ROC for your model:

```
# first arrange the appointments dataset by the predicted probability vector, in a descending order
# then, using mutate compute the cumulative sum of real no shows divided by the total number of no shows
# using another mutate, compute the cumulative sum of show-ups divided by the total number of show-ups

appointments_roc <- appointments %>%
   arrange(desc(XXX)) %>%
   mutate(tpr = cumsum(XXX)/sum(XXX)) %>%
   mutate(fpr = cumsum(!XXX)/sum(!XXX))

# can you explain why this works? hint, think about what your are doing when you are sorting
# the probability column.

# plot the resulting line
ggplot(appointments_roc, aes(x = fpr, y = tpr)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  xlab("False positive rate (1 - Specificity)") + 
  ylab("True positive rate (Sensitivity)") + 
  ggtitle("An ROC for our medical appointment logistic regression model")
  geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1)

```

```{r hidden code to solve the ROC tibble, include=FALSE}

appointments_roc <- appointments %>%
  filter(!is_train) %>%
  arrange(desc(probability_no_show)) %>%
  mutate(tpr=cumsum(no_show)/sum(no_show),
         fpr=cumsum(!no_show)/sum(!no_show))

```
```{r how to draw an ROC, include=TRUE}

ggplot(appointments_roc, aes(x = fpr, y = tpr)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  xlab("False positive rate (1 - Specificity)") + 
  ylab("True positive rate (Sensitivity)") + 
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent) + 
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
  ggtitle("An ROC for our medical appointment logistic regression model") +
  geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1)

```
```{r add code comparing lm with the logistic, include = FALSE}
# appointments_lm_model <- lm(formula = 
#                             no_show ~ Gender + Age + Scholarship + Hipertension + Diabetes +
#                             Alcoholism + Handcap + SMS_received,
#                             data = appointments %>% filter(is_train))
# 
# appointments_roc_lm <- appointments %>%
#   mutate(probability_no_show = predict(object = appointments_lm_model, newdata = appointments)) %>%
#   mutate(probability_no_show = case_when(probability_no_show > 1 ~ 1,
#                                          probability_no_show < 0 ~ 0,
#                                          TRUE ~ probability_no_show)) %>%

```

What is the meaning of the $y=x$ line on the ROC?
What would you do if the ROC is completely under the $y=x$ line?
